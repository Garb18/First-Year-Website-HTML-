      <h1>A little bit of history...</h1>
      <br><br>
      <!--Main page article-->
      <article id="pAbout"> Shrub Hill Cattery is a family run cat shelter for abandoned cats, that was founded by my mother and I back in 1995.

        My mother grew up with animals and she showed us how to care for them, to take care of them, to love them, and to respect them as well. She has history with medical and veterinary experience, so this lends our cattery a lot of safety and
        stability. We are very thankful for that.

        Growing up in England, my sister and I shared our knowledge and love for animals; especially cats. We would rescue many strays and find homes for them, or keep the ones that we absolutely couldn’t give away. So one day, we heard about this
        cat exhibition taking place in Birmingham - and after attending, we saw these magnificent cats and were completely fascinated.

        I started researching about cat history, learning about their personality, characteristics, bloodlines, genetic disorders, grooming, showing, and breeding. I started talking with breeders all over the world. It
        was very important to me, obsessive I suppose you could say, to educate myself as much and in depth as possible about this fascinating animal.

        It wasn’t very long until we found our very first rescue, Arthur. We were absolutely in love with him. We felt very special to be doing some good in the world

        One night, our family had a very serious talk about starting a cattery together. We were feeling confident enough about it, since we had educated ourselves about different cat breeds and their standards. With our combined medical knowledge,
        feline experience, and most important - our unconditional love for this animal, we were ready. We decided to start a rescue cattery.

      <h2><u>We run for the needs of our cats, not for the needs of a business</u></h2>
      <br><br>
      <em>We think you have a right to know what we do for a living, so we try to be as transparent as possible...</em>
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, there are far too many catterys who live exclusively from their cattery’s income, or believe they can somehow get rich from a cattery - which inherently means that they cannot practice the field in a fully ethical way, nor
        can they justify spending money for all of the required health examinations, high quality food, and the list goes on. Not to mention the high output and terrible living conditions they ask of their stock. Long story short,
        "business catteries" cut corners in ways that are so unethical it would make your skin crawl.
        <br><br>
        Our cats live freely with us, in our home. You won't find any cages, and we do not allow our offspring kittens to live in a cattery or home where there will be cages. We want a cage-free environment and we want our cats to have as much
        room as they want. They live with us because they are part of our family. In this way, we succeed in raising up incredibly lovable rescue cats with the most calm temperament and non-aggressive behavior - always ready to cuddle with you!

        Our active males have their own big space, separated from all the females. They do not spray, and do not fight. They live together peacefully and very harmoniously. The same goes for our females, and they alternate their time with "run of
        the house".
